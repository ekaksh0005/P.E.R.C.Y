About PERCY
PERCY is an innovative disaster management solution designed to address flood emergencies. It's an attachable kit that can be mounted on any commercial car, enabling vehicles to float during severe floods, thus ensuring passenger safety and reducing reliance on emergency services.

Developed by Pranav Verma, Parantap Mishra, Varun Arora and Ekaksh Goyal from Lotus Valley International School, Noida, PERCY aims to provide an accessible, affordable, and adaptable solution for personal vehicles to navigate submerged roads safely.

The Problem
Floods are one of the most devastating natural disasters, affecting millions of people globally every year:

In India alone, over 20 million individuals face the dire consequences of flooding annually
These consequences include loss of life, displacement, and damage to infrastructure
Climate change is accelerating the frequency and intensity of floods
Emergency response teams are often overwhelmed, delayed, or unavailable during crises
There is a lack of accessible solutions for personal vehicles to navigate submerged roads safely
Our Solution
PERCY is an attachable kit consisting of:

Air tubes for flotation
Multiple depth sensors
High-capacity air pumps
When floodwaters rise above a critical threshold, PERCY activates its flotation mechanism, inflating tubes to provide essential buoyancy and allowing the car to float in critical situations.

Key Components
Depth Sensors: Strategically positioned around the vehicle to constantly monitor water levels
Flotation Mechanism: Tubes that inflate to provide buoyancy
Air Pumps: High-capacity pumps that quickly inflate the tubes
Manual Deployment: Ability for the driver to manually deploy the system for redundancy
Advantages
Ensures Safety: Prevents vehicle submersion, safeguarding passengers
Universal Fit: Compatible with most commercial vehicles
Cost-Effective: Affordable design for widespread accessibility
Reduces Dependence: Minimizes reliance on emergency services
Enhanced Mobility: Optional paddles enable navigation in flooded areas
